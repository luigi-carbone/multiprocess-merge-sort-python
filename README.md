# Parallel Merge Sort in Python

This project implements the **Merge Sort** algorithm using Python and parallel processing. The program sorts an array of numbers by splitting the workload across multiple processes, leveraging the `multiprocessing` module to speed up the sorting for large datasets.

## Features

- Implementation of the classic Merge Sort algorithm.
- Parallel execution using Python's `multiprocessing` module to improve performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Exampple of usage

> python parallel_processing.py N_ELEMENTS MAX_VALUE

- N_ELEMENTS: cardinality of vector to be generated
- MAX_VALUE: maximum value desired
